# Security Policy

Thanks for caring about security! We take reports seriously — here’s how to responsibly disclose issues.

## Reporting a vulnerability
1. If you discover a security issue, **do not** create a public issue. Instead, email the maintainer:

   nitish@example.com

   Include:
   - A concise description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce or a PoC (if safe to share)
   - Any impact analysis (data exposure, escalation, etc.)

2. We will respond within a few business days to acknowledge receipt and provide next steps.

## What to expect
- We’ll investigate and, if necessary, privately coordinate a fix and release before public disclosure.
- If the issue is severe, we may need additional details (logs, environment information) to reproduce.

## Responsible disclosure guidelines
- Avoid public disclosure of sensitive PoC details until a fix is available.
- Do not exploit any bug you find for personal gain.

Thanks — your help keeps this project safe and healthy!

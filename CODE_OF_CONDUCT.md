# Contributor Code of Conduct

We want this repo to be friendly, helpful, and mildly delightful. By participating you agree to the following:

## Our Standards
- Be kind and respectful. Treat people like humans, not like error logs.
- Be patient — not everyone codes at warp speed.
- Be inclusive — different backgrounds and skill levels are celebrated.
- Feedback should be constructive, concise, and humane.

## Unacceptable Behaviour
Don't do these things (we’ll assume you know):
- Harassment, hateful or discriminatory language
- Threats, doxxing, stalking, or targeted abuse
- Repeated trolling, spamming, or derailing conversations
- Posting private information without consent

If you spot something that looks like a violation, please report it — we want to know.

## Reporting & Enforcement
If you see bad behaviour:
1. Open an issue
2. If it’s urgent (threats, doxxing), please contact the repository owner directly and include screenshots or links.

Maintainers will investigate and may remove content or ban users if required. If you disagree with a decision, raise a private issue and we’ll talk it through respectfully.

This Code of Conduct is intentionally short and human — be kind, and let’s keep making awesome doodles together.

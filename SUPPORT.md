# Support & Contact

Need help or want to chat about doodles? Here’s how:

## Open an Issue (best for most questions)
- Found a bug? Open a new issue and include steps to reproduce, the expected behavior, and screenshots if relevant.
- Want a new feature or icon pack? Feature requests live in issues too.

## Pull Requests
PRs are welcome — and usually the fastest way to get something into the project. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

## Private or sensitive issues
If you need to report something sensitive (security issue, doxxing, or anything you prefer not to post publicly), email the project maintainer:

> nitish@example.com

(Replace with a real contact address if you'd like — I used a placeholder here.)

## Sponsorship / Business Inquiries
If you want to sponsor the project, hire the maintainer, or talk about commercial licensing, please open an issue or contact via the email above.

## Community
There is no official chat or forum for this project yet. If you want one (Discord/Matrix/Slack), open an issue and propose it.

Thanks for supporting the project — it’s small but mighty, and community contributions keep it shiny.
